graphics / sound. straightforward <-- this is important. I can do this without thinking about it and without knowing
what is the right next step.

********************************************************************************************************************

file access
- but graphics files should be handled by the GUI or GFX server process
- maybe later

graphics
- very specialized, but straightforward and allows gfx file handling

GUI
- separate GUI / gfx APIs
- separate GUI / gfx server processes (?) - probably

sound
- basic sound output is simple
- allows sound file handling

network
- ?

high level APIs
- permissions unclear, but maybe think about that later. Features first, to allow me to understand the system.
- most high level system APIs need a file system first
- probably a high level file system, not just files and folders
